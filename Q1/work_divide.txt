type_a, type_e, type_f to be done by anushka - done
type_b to be done by hemanth - done
type_c to be done by adi - done
type_d to be done by harsh - done
error handling to be done by harsh, adi and hemanth - //there are 9 error handling cases just put your name against which you will do and let me know
    a) Typos in instruction name or register name - Adi
    b) Use of undefined variables 
    c) Use of undefined labels - adi
    d) Illegal use of FLAGS register - Harsh
    e) Illegal Immediate values (more than 7 bits) - Harsh
    f) Misuse of labels as variables or vice-versa
    g) Variables not declared at the beginning
    h) Missing hlt instruction
    i) hlt not being used as the last instruction - adi // for this i think we might have to change our input format in which we are reading 
    line by line instead we can take input like read the whole file and have nested list with each line in a form of line
    eg: [["add","R1","R2","R3"],["mul","R2","R3","R4"],....] something like this i havent done it yet but if thought so pls lmk.
anushka has to do flag semantics
then we start by writing code for handling the all the instructions and the main part of the code
