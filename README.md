For Assembler:  (Question 1)
    An assembler is a software tool that converts assembly language source code into machine code, which can be directly executed by a processor.
    In our case, we have developed an assembler using Python. It takes input from a file through standard input (stdin) and converts it into 16-bit binary code. The resulting binary code is saved in an output file called "output.txt" and is also displayed in the terminal.
    Our assembler has a priority handling mechanism, means it handles errors based on priorities given in the error dictionary. This means that if multiple errors exist in a program, only the first error encountered from the dictionary will be displayed and the program will come to a halt.
