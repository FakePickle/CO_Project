error handling to be done by harsh, adi and hemanth - //there are 9 error handling cases just put your name against which you will do and let me know
    a) Typos in instruction name or register name
    b) Use of undefined variables
    c) Use of undefined labels
    d) Illegal use of FLAGS register
    e) Illegal Immediate values (more than 7 bits)
    f) Misuse of labels as variables or vice-versa
    g) Variables not declared at the beginning
    h) Missing hlt instruction
    i) hlt not being used as the last instruction
anushka has to do flag semantics
then we start by writing code for handling the all the instructions and the main part of the code
